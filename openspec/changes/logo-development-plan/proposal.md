## Why

KudiKlass currently lacks a distinctive logo that communicates its core value proposition of secure educational payments. A professional logo is essential for building trust with Nigerian parents and schools, establishing brand recognition in the competitive fintech-education space, and immediately conveying security and reliability to users who are handling sensitive financial transactions for their children's education.
