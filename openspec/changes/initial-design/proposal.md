# Proposal: Naija Eazy Pay - Initial Design

## Context
Naija Eazy Pay aims to be a leading online payment service for schools in Nigeria, mirroring the functionality and user experience of [ParentPay](https://www.parentpay.com/). The goal is to provide a cashless payment system for schools, parents, and caterers, adapting the proven model of ParentPay to the Nigerian market.

## Problem
Schools in Nigeria typically rely on cash or direct bank transfers for payments (fees, meals, excursions), which can be inefficient, hard to track, and insecure. Parents need a convenient, centralized platform to manage payments for multiple children and services.

## Goals
1.  **Design a robust platform** that handles school payments, mirroring ParentPay's core features (Cashless Payments, Meal Management, Trips).
2.  **Create wireframes** for the key user interfaces (Landing Page, Dashboard, Payment Flow).
3.  **Define the technical architecture** for the application.

## Scope
-   **Public Website**: Landing page, Services overview, "Who we help" sections.
-   **Parent Portal**: Login, Dashboard, Payment processing for meals and trips.
-   **School Portal**: (High-level design) Administration dashboard for managing payments and students.
-   **Brand Identity**: Adapted for the Nigerian market ("Naija Eazy Pay") while maintaining a professional, trustworthy trust (similar to ParentPay).

## Out of Scope
-   Full implementation (this change focuses on design and wireframing).
-   Integration with specific Nigerian banks (mocked for design).
-   Legal/Compliance framework.

## Success Criteria
-   A clear, approved design specification.
-   Wireframes for the main pages (Landing, Login, Dashboard).
-   A defined data model and API structure.
